The React frontend acts as an interface for the user to see all their data, add new data, and
remove unwanted data. 


I want to make a website where the owner of a dance company can make an account which stores data
send a link
to their choreographers which inserts their dance into the owner's account. The choreographer can
enter the names of each dancer in their dance. The choreographers will only be able to add dancer
names which are already populated into the "dancerNames" list established by the owner.

The owner will be able to manually enter the names of dancers. They can also manually add dances.

Data Structures for ORGANIZATION:

array
-SEMESTER
 --id (int)
 --season (string)
 --year (int)
 --dancers (DANCER list)
 --officers (DANCER list)
 --performances (PERFORMANCE list)

array
-DANCER
 --id (int)
 --dancerName (string)
 --email (string)
 --phoneNumber (string)
 --duesPaid (bool)

array
-PERFORMANCE
 --id (int)
 --name (string)
 --choreographer (DANCER)
 --dancers (DANCER list)
