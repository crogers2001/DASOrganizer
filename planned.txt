NEW: Make it so the performance form properly sends an array of dancers



Make it so each performance and dancer has a unique ID loaded when added to the jsons



Find out the best way to edit data. For example, if the choreographer edits their dancer list,
do you delete the entire array from the "dancer" property and send the new dancer array? Or,
are you supposed to search for the exact index of the dancer from the database and change that
one entry?
